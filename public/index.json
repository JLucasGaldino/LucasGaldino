[{"content":"I am a Brazilian-Canadian programmer and student of biology living in Sherbrooke, Quebec. I am fascinated by how our mind works, and how it affects our experience of reality. In particular, I want to understand how it is shaped by the various rituals, habits, and practices that permeate our daily life.\nIn this website, as well as in my YouTube channel, I will be publishing various articles, essays, and videos on the subjects of neuroscience, health, technology, and phylosophy. I will also, occasionally, share some free-form writing, such as poems or thoughts.\nMy goal in this endeavour is to discover, research, and experiment with different practices and their effect on our mental and physical health, and to share this discovery with you. We\u0026rsquo;ll discuss how to apply these tools in daily life and the science behind them. Because I believe science should be made available to all. Health should be made available to all.\nI hope that you might find some value and enjoyment in my videos and writings.\n","permalink":"https://www.lucasgaldino.com/about/","summary":"I am a Brazilian-Canadian programmer and student of biology living in Sherbrooke, Quebec.
